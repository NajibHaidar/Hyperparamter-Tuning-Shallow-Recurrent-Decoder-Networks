### Abstract

In this study, we explore the impact of time lag, noise, and the number of sensors on the performance of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based decoder model in the context of sea-surface temperature prediction. The model is trained on sea-surface temperature data, with the objective of understanding the underlying temporal and spatial patterns that drive these temperatures. The performance of the model is then examined under varying conditions such as different time lags, addition of Gaussian noise to the data, and changing the number of sensors in the input data. The insights gained from this study can be instrumental in understanding the intricacies of applying LSTM models to environmental prediction tasks, and the factors that can significantly influence their performance.

### Introduction and Overview

**Introduction:**

The prediction of sea-surface temperature is a significant task in environmental science and meteorology. Given the temporal and spatial complexity of sea-surface temperature patterns, machine learning models, specifically those capable of handling sequential data such as LSTM, have emerged as powerful tools to tackle this problem.

However, the performance of these models can be influenced by several factors, including the time lag between observations, the level of noise in the data, and the number of sensors used to capture the measurements. Understanding the impact of these factors on model performance is crucial for optimizing these models and ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.

In this study, we train an LSTM-based model on sea-surface temperature data, and systematically vary the time lag, noise, and the number of sensors to analyze their impact on the model's performance. The aim is to understand how these factors influence the model's ability to capture and predict sea-surface temperature patterns, and to provide insights that can help in the design and application of LSTM models for similar tasks in the future.

**Overview:**

The remainder of this study is organized as follows:

First, we present the LSTM-based model used in this study, and detail the procedure for training the model on the sea-surface temperature data. This includes an explanation of how the time lag, noise, and the number of sensors are incorporated into the model and the training process.

Next, we present the results of our experiments. For each of the factors under consideration - time lag, noise, and the number of sensors - we present an analysis of how changes in that factor influence the model's performance. This includes both quantitative results, such as changes in prediction accuracy, and qualitative observations about how the model's predictions change.

Finally, we conclude with a summary of our findings, highlighting the key insights gained about the impact of time lag, noise, and the number of sensors on the performance of LSTM models in the context of sea-surface temperature prediction. We also discuss potential implications of these findings for future work in this area.
